- torch 2.5.1 (or other compatible version with cuda)
- numpy 2.2.0
- matplotlib 3.10.1

## Usage
- run any of these jupyter notebook file can start the training process
- in model folder, there are some models that can be used
- while training process finished, the trained model will be saved in model folder
- at the end of the notebook, you can run prediction directly on the test set and get the accuracy
